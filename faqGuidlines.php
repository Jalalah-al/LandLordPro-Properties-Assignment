<p>FAQ: Renting and Leasing Guidelines
This document is designed to help you understand the process of renting and leasing before you sign an agreement. Knowing your rights and responsibilities can help you avoid issues and ensure a smooth experience.
________________________________________
1. What is the difference between renting and leasing?
•	Renting – A short-term agreement (month-to-month or up to six months) with more flexibility.
•	Leasing – A fixed-term contract (typically 6 to 12 months) with set terms and penalties for early termination.
________________________________________
2. What documents are required to apply?
You’ll usually need:
•	Proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements)
•	Photo ID (driver’s license or passport)
•	Rental history and landlord references
•	Authorization for a credit check
________________________________________
3. How does the credit check process work?
The landlord will assess your credit score and history to evaluate your ability to pay rent. A strong credit score may help you secure better terms.
________________________________________
4. What is a security deposit, and how much is it?
A security deposit is a refundable payment (typically equal to one month’s rent) to cover damages or unpaid rent. It is refunded if no damage or unpaid rent is found when you move out.
________________________________________
5. What other upfront costs should I expect?
You may need to pay:
•	First and last month’s rent
•	Application fees
•	Pet deposit (if applicable)
________________________________________
6. What should I look for in a lease agreement?
Key terms to review:
•	Length of lease and renewal terms
•	Rent amount and due date
•	Maintenance and repair responsibilities
•	Rules on pets, subletting, and guests
________________________________________
7. Can rent increase during the lease period?
Rent is usually fixed during a lease term. For month-to-month agreements, landlords can increase rent with proper notice (usually 30–60 days).
________________________________________
8. What happens if I break my lease early?
You may lose your security deposit or be required to pay a termination fee (often 1–2 months’ rent). Some leases allow early termination with specific conditions.
________________________________________
9. Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance?
•	Landlord’s responsibility – Structural issues, plumbing, heating, and electrical systems.
•	Tenant’s responsibility – Minor repairs, cleanliness, and any damage caused by misuse.
________________________________________
10. Can I make changes to the property (e.g., paint or install fixtures)?
Most leases require landlord approval for changes. Unauthorized changes may result in repair costs deducted from your security deposit.
________________________________________
11. Are pets allowed?
Check the lease for pet policies. Some landlords allow pets with a pet deposit or monthly pet fee, while others may prohibit pets.
________________________________________
12. How much notice is required to move out?
•	For leases – Usually 30 to 60 days’ written notice before the lease ends.
•	For month-to-month agreements – 30-day notice is standard.
________________________________________
13. How can I ensure I get my security deposit back?
•	Clean the property thoroughly.
•	Repair any damage caused during your stay.
•	Provide proper notice and document the property's condition when you move out.
________________________________________
14. Can I sublet my apartment?
Some leases allow subletting with landlord approval. Unauthorized subletting may be grounds for eviction.
________________________________________
15. What happens if the landlord sells the property?
Your lease remains valid even if the property is sold. The new owner must honour the terms until the lease ends.
________________________________________
16. What should I do if I have a dispute with my landlord?
•	Try to resolve the issue through communication.
•	If unresolved, contact a local housing authority, tenant rights group, or seek legal advice.
